codekit-kickoff
===============

A scaffolding for use with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)

## Purpose & Dependency

I use **CodeKit** daily and do a lot of prototyping with several libraries that provide me a lot of efficiency. As such, I have been working on developing a kickoff project to easily get up and running with this base application whenever I want to get a prototype to hit the ground running. 

While I understand that CodeKit provides a framework concept, much of what I do is hand files off to others who may or may not be using CodeKit. The following kickoff project allows me to build a project easily in a modular way that can allow another developer to either choose to use the CodeKit compiling engine.  Alternately I can choose to only supply the primary `/html` and `/app` folders and the project will just "fire up" without the need for CodeKit. For me, this is currently ideal. 

With this in mind, CodeKit is obviously a dependency to this project. While you could likely untangle the web with not a lot of effort, the purpose of this project 
is to be used with CodeKit.

## Acknowledgement

CodeKit, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, Twitter Bootstrap, Font-Awesome, and Normalize.css are can all be used within this project. I find these frameworks and libraries invaluable to my daily work. I thank everyone who has contributed to them, since they've saved me countless hours.

To that end, each of these frameworks and libraries have their own Licensing Restrictions. It is your responsibility to be aware of them.

**NOTE:** 

**APPLICATION COMPILING**: The CodeKit compiler relies, in this case, upon the `codekit-config.json` file, which has been pre-configured to build specific files into default folders following the structure above. 

So it's IMPORTANT to remember what files are being compiled by CodeKit and which files are NOT being compiled -- thus are editable. In most circumstances, you DO NOT want to edit files that are listed as COMPILED below.

Similarly, you should not edit any of the Library `/lib` files or folders either, as they are layed out in their respective folder structures as expected by their own dependencies. This will allow us to easily upgrade the libraries without unnecessary intervention.

**COMPILED Files (Do Not Edit Directly):**

	├── app/css/app.min.css
	├── app/js/app.min.js
	└── html/index.html

**NOTE**: As mentioned above, there are times when I want to hand the compiled files off to another developer not using CodeKit, thereby they will probably want to edit these compiled files. 

When this occurs, I simply do not provide the `/build` folder and configure CodeKit to compile `app.min.js` and `app.min.css` without any concatenation or minification. This way the other developer(s) have the opportunity to intervene or review the code. 

It is important to remember, however, that it is probably safer for those developers to create their own CSS file to import so that you don't end up colliding with them or overwriting their development in the 
event that you build and compile at a later date.

### Application Files
All Production support files reside in the `/app` folder. As mentioned, it is best in most circumstances to not edit these files, since they are compiled from other sources.

### Build Files
All Build files reside in the `/build` folder

**LESS (/build/less)**:
This project uses [LESS CSS](http://lesscss.org) for managing all style elements. CodeKit has the ability to compile the LESS code to a unified CSS file. The default management of this file is to leverage the `build/less/app.less` file for handling all imports, including all "partial" LESS files, which reside in the `build/less/partials` folder. 

A good usage of this might be to create a `header.less` file that defines all of the styles related to the header of a document. The `app.less` file would then import the `header.less` file. The final output upon compilation from CodeKit would be the `app/css/app.min.css` under the default management of this project. 

**NOTE**: If you prefer to use [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) vs. LESS, this is fine, but you would need to port over all of the variables, etc. that are currently used to SASS syntax. 

frameworks and libraries: While I prefer to use CodeKit, if you prefer to use something else to work with LESS, there are many options to remove CodeKit from this workflow, which include the usage of [other compilers](http://fadeyev.net/2012/02/16/less-update/) or the default LESS process, which utilizes a JavaScript compiler within the DOM. 

**KITS (/build/kits)**:
This project takes advantage of CodeKit's [kit language](http://incident57.com/codekit/kit.php). This allows you to build html includes (such as header/footer, etc.) without the need to use a dynamic language. This is very beneficial for rapid prototyping with reused elements. The default usage of this feature within this project is to create your primary kit files `/build/kits/index.kit` and include any partials `/build/kits/partials` for any reused elements. CodeKit is configured in this project to then compile the `index.kit` file to `index.html` within the `/html` folder.

**JS (/build/js)**:
This project compiles its JavaScript into a minified and JSLint(ed) output file `/app/js/app.min.js`. Through CodeKit, part of the compiling process is to prepend jQuery by default. 

If you choose, you can also prepend other libraries via CodeKit's prepending ability. Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery Mobile both will be detected by CodeKit for prepending/appending to your JavaScript file, but in order to include them, you will have to manually drag them into the prepend/appended state within CodeKit.

### HTML Files
All Production HTML files reside in the `/html` folder. As mentioned, it is best in most circumstances to not edit these files, since they are compiled from other
sources.

### Library Files
All third-party Library files reside in the `/lib` folder

**NOTE**: All library dependent style includes are activated and deactivated within the `/build/less/app.less` file. To activate or deactivate a library's style, simply commend or uncomment that library's includes within "app.less"

**NOTE**: The folder structure of the libraries has been retained for easy management of the libraries themselves.
